**CH₄ emissions and wetland inundation of the Lake Chad region**

In this project, we quantify CH₄ emissions and wetland inundation of the Lake Chad region. This repository contains the code to process raw satellite data and wetland inundation mapping, as well as to produce the accompanying figures of the manuscript. CH₄ emission estimates derived using the divergence method can be provided upon request. The analysis in this repository is associated to a manuscript currently under review.
1. Folder Source Data contains all the sources to reproduce the main results and figures in the paper.
2. Code_data_production.txt, uses Sentinel-2 data and a phenology-based method to map inundated vegetation and open water on the Google Earth Engine platform.
3. Code_figures.txt, uses the outputs to do the main figures of the manuscript.
